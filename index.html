	 Ciao! I'm a 19-year-old Italian guy currently studying at ESSEC. Life for me is a delightful blend of passions and pursuits. At heart, I'm a football enthusiast, finding joy in every match, every goal, and every moment on the field. Music is another essential part of who I am; I love exploring new melodies. Another passion of mine is being in contact with nature.

     <h2> Football </h2>
     <p> As an AC Milan fan, I'm deeply immersed in the world of football. From the electrifying atmosphere of San Siro to the strategic plays on the pitch, every match is a thrilling experience. I feel a strong connection to the club's history, its iconic players, and the passionate fan base. Whether it's cheering for my beloved Rossoneri from the stands or discussing tactics with fellow fans, my love for AC Milan runs deep. <p>

     <h2> Music </h2>
     <p> When it comes to music, the Red Hot Chili Peppers hold a special place in my heart. Their infectious blend of funk, rock, and soul speaks to me on a profound level. From the raw energy of "Give It Away" to the introspective vibes of "Under the Bridge," their music resonates with me in ways that few others do. Whether I'm jamming out with friends or losing myself in the lyrics, the Red Hot Chili Peppers never fail to lift my spirits and ignite my passion for music. <p>

	 <h2> Hiking and outdoor activities </h2>
     <p> Exploring the great outdoors is where I feel most alive. Whether it's trekking through the majestic mountains of the Italian Alps or venturing into the lush forests of the countryside, there's something magical about being surrounded by nature. Hiking not only allows me to challenge myself physically but also provides moments of tranquility and reflection. Whether I'm admiring breathtaking views from a summit or setting up camp under the stars, each outdoor adventure fills me with a sense of wonder and appreciation for the world around me. <p>
